The units of my power spectrum?) are handled effortlessly, leaving room to focus on higher-level problems.","category":"page"},{"location":"types/","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"To achieve this, TimeseriesTools.jl defines a custom version of the DimensionalData.DimArray and custom DimensionalData.Dimensions:","category":"page"},{"location":"types/","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"x = Timeseries(1:10, rand(10))\nx isa AbstractToolsArray # In most cases, an AbstractToolsArray behaves like a DimArray; see DimensionalData\nx isa AbstractTimeSeries # An AbstractTimeSeries is an AbstractToolsArray...\nlookup(x, 1) isa 𝑡 # ...where the first dimension is a custom TimeDim 𝑡","category":"page"},{"location":"types/","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"If a ToolsArray or DimArray has a 𝑡 as its first dimension, it will be rebuilt as a ToolsArray (i.e. when using functions like eachcol).
